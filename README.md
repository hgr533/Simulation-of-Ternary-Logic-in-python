Explanation of the Code

Ternary Logic Gates: The code defines ternary_and (minimum of two values), ternary_or (maximum), and ternary_not (inverts -1 to +1, +1 to -1, 0 stays 0), which are foundational operations for ternary circuits.
Ternary MAC: The ternary_mac function simulates a multiply-accumulate operation, critical for AI inference on ternary chips. It multiplies ternary inputs and weights, sums them, and clips the result to {-1, 0, +1}, mimicking how a ternary chip reduces computational complexity.
Neural Network Layer: The ternary_layer function applies the MAC operation across multiple neurons, simulating a layer in a ternary neural network, as used in the 2025 CNT chip for tasks like image recognition.
Output Example: Running the code with sample inputs [1, -1, 0, 1] and two sets of weights produces ternary outputs, demonstrating how a chip might process data.

Notes

This is a high-level simulation, not executable on an actual ternary chip, as real chips would use low-level ternary circuits (e.g., CNT-based transistors) and custom instruction sets.
For real ternary hardware, you’d need a specialized compiler or firmware, which isn’t publicly available for the 2025 chip. This Python code abstracts the logic for clarity.
The code aligns with the ternary AI chip’s focus on efficient neural network inference, as described in the 2025 breakthrough, by minimizing operations while maintaining functionality.
